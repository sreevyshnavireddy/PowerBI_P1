Key Measures -
The formula, "Average Revenue = AVERAGE(Sales[Revenue (USD)])", is a basic calculation used in data analysis to determine the average or mean value of a specific data set. Let me break it down for you:

Average Revenue: This is the result or output of the calculation. It represents the average or mean value of a particular data set, which in this case is the revenue.

AVERAGE(): This is a function commonly used in spreadsheet software and data analysis tools like Excel or Power BI. It calculates the average of a range of numbers or a column of data. In this formula, it's used to calculate the average revenue.

Sales[Revenue (USD)]: This part of the formula specifies the data source from which the average is calculated. It tells the software to look in the "Sales" table (or dataset) and specifically in the column labeled "Revenue (USD)" to gather the numbers for the calculation.

So, when we use this formula, the software will go to "Sales" dataset, collect all the values in the "Revenue (USD)" column, add them up, and then divide the total by the number of values to calculate the average revenue. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this would work:
1.	Gather all the values in the "Revenue (USD)" column of your "Sales" dataset.
2.	Add up all these values to get the total revenue.
3.	Count the number of values in the "Revenue (USD)" column.
4.	Divide the total revenue by the number of values to calculate the average revenue.

The result will be the average revenue earned based on the data in the "Revenue (USD)" column of "Sales" dataset. This can be useful for understanding the typical or average amount of revenue generated in a particular context, such as for a specific product, time period, or category.
